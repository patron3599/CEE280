Stanford University - Advanced Structural Analysis 

This repository contains the final programming project for the advanced structural analysis course. It uses object-oriented programming 
to build and store the information of your model and then execute it's analysis using matrix structural analysis and the stiffness method. 
The use of this code is done through MASTAN2 (https://www.mastan2.com/) which is a MATLAB backed structural analysis program. 

Adhering to the Stanford Honor Code, the code in this repository is not meant to be used for future projects or assignments.
